        <div class="eeveelutiontext namelabel">
            <h5>Farm</h5>
            <p>The farm is just a farm. I mean what did you expect? You're probably here to see what we're growing. Our current selection is not big, we only grow nature mints and oran berries. <br><br>The farm is exactly in the top-left corner on the map.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="eeveelutiontext namelabel">
            <h5>Treehouse</h5>
            <p>The treehouse is the place we all live in. It's an overgrown tree with a lot of floors inside. Each floor has many rooms, empty or occupied. It doesn't have a basement or cellar. It has a very spacious kitchen and even even bigger living room. Don't go up to the attic tho. That room is personalized for Ash and his belongings, so if you go up there and touch anything, you'll probably die. <br><br>The treehosue is located under the farm.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="eeveelutiontext namelabel">
            <h5>Ash's workfield</h5>
            <p>This giant space is extremely large, and mostly empty as of the moment. It has 2 landing pads with 2 different spaceships, a training ground and an area full of growth chambers. As long as you steer clear of this space, Ash will not end your life. <br><br>The workfield is located under the treehouse, colored in darker grey.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="eeveelutiontext namelabel">
            <h5>Danger Area</h5>
            <p>This specific spot contains a every dangerous thing ever, including a Max Lair. Pokemon found here are usually above lvl. 95 with IVs of 100%. <br><br>Suggestion: Avoid this area at all costs. <br><br>The danger area is located East of the workfield, colored in red on the map.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="eeveelutiontext namelabel">
            <h5>City</h5>
            <p>There's not much to say about this. This city is located east of the treehouse, and it contains a pokecenter, pokemart, hotels, everything you could ever ask for. Unfortunately, there are plenty of trainers too, so if you come across one either hide or run away. If he wants a fight, feel free to fight them, tho if they successfully capture you you can say goodbye to the treehouse. <br><br>The city is located at the bottom right corner.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="eeveelutiontext namelabel">
            <h5>Orchard</h5>
            <p>This is just an orchard that grows all types of berries and trees. If you need ingredients for something, this is most likely the place to go if it's plants you're looking for. <br><br>The orchard is located at the top left corner of the map, colored in light green.</p>
